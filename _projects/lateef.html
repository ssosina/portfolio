	<h3>1. Challenge</h3>
	<p>By day Lateef Saka is a project manager at GE renewable energies. By nights and weekends he’s an avid blogger and fashion enthusiast. The problem was Lateef needed a personal blogging platform to voice his opinions on topics that he felt passionate about such as political affairs, fashion, travel and culture. He needed a system to create and store all his articles and all associated media.</p>
 
	<p>The challenge was to create a responsive blog site using Wordpress CMS and applying a custom theme.</p>

	<h3>2. Approach</h3>
	<p>Simplicity and elegance was the ultimate goal for the design of the website. Bold photographic images is what would add elements of elegances and style to bring the site to life. </p>

		<p>The Wordpress CMS was leveraged to handle the backend functionalities of creating, storing and updating content. Additionally, a custom theme was developed from the ground up. Most of the development process was handled using Gulp (browsersync, Bourbon, Neat) and Git (Github). </p>

		<p>A mobile first approach was adopted with four breakpoints attributes for mobile, tablet, desktop and large screens. The site relies on quality visuals so responsive images and srcset attribute were used at every opportunity. Additionally responsive images wouldn't kill the bandwidth for mobile users, so it was no brainer.</p>

	<h3>3.Outcome </h3>
</div>

<div>
	<p>The site successfully launched on March 8th this year and was approved and accepted by Google Adsense to house ads the following month on the first submission! Here are three things I learnt  – </p>

	<p>Testing is important – Making quick fixes for quick wins. I will never under value testing after this project and will start it at the beginning of a project and continue post launch. </p>
 
	<p>Always Mobile first – A mobile optimised website was key as Lateef’s social presence was driven by mobile optimised applications, such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Since the launch on Mar 8th, 64.28% of site visitors came from mobile devices! </p>
 
	<p>Automation + workflow – Since moving from Photoshop to Sketch i’ve found the use of plugins to be critical to achieving a fast workflow for example. The craft plugin helped me quickly move prototypes from Sketch to Invision in a push of a button. I also found Gulp to be priceless in helping to automate tasks that would so often waste time. </p>
